# Calculator

This is my attempt at creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Once working, you will be able to see how it functions by clicking on "github-pages" under the heading "Environments" 
(github-pages available now but calculator is still a work-in-progress and not fully functional yet).

## Purpose Of This Project

I am undertaking this project in order to learn and practice CSS Grid and to solidify my working knowledge of JavaScript.

## Status

- Semi-Functional for basic operations inputted in a linear fashion but needs a lot of refinement to be more functional and intuitive.
- Need to add logic for:
    - Deleting characters
    - Adding a decimal to a number
