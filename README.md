# Calculator

This is my attempt at creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Once working, you will be able to see how it functions by clicking on "github-pages" under the heading "Environments" (not available yet).

## Purpose Of This Project

I am undertaking this project in order to practice CSS Grid and solidify my knowledge of JavaScript.
