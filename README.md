# Calculator

This is my attempt at creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Purpose Of This Project

I undertook this project to:
1. Learn about and practice CSS Grid
2. Practice and solidify my working knowledge of JavaScript
3. Refresh my knowledge of Git, CSS and JavaScript.

## How To Access and Use

You can see how the Calculator functions by visiting this [link](https://v-imv.github.io/js-calculator/) or by clicking on "github-pages" under the heading "Environments" on the right hand side of the GitHub repository screen.

## What I Learned From This Project
- How to use CSS Grid
- Data type conversion
- How to use arrow functions in JavaScript
- The importance of having a project specification/user stories before beginning programming (I learned that it's very important to be clear on what the project should deliver and how it should function before starting programming to avoid coming up with functionality as you go as I did with this project...)
- How to create a git branch, work on it, merge it to main and delete it.

## Status

- Calculator is mostly functional.
- Can still add logic for:
    - Deleting characters
    - Adding a decimal to a number
- Could add additional buttons for features such as:
  - Working with percentages %
  - Changing a number from positive to negative and vice versa
